**Content**

This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas
that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks. They can
include many different topics, such as

-   models, especially domain models

-   architecture or design patterns

-   rules for using specific technology

-   principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (=
    cross-cutting) nature

-   implementation rules
